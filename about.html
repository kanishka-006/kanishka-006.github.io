     <div class="right">
      <p >Passionate for coding.Considering civil aspects,I have interest in geomatics (UAV,satellite Technology etc.). I prefer not to talk mostly.
          Not an introvert though,talk to new people very comfortably but don't make new friends easily in short don't mingle easily.Love to visit new
          places and have new experiences.Till now didn't visit many places but have craze to visit new places in future.Innovations excite me a lot!!
          I don't have much interest in web series etc but love to read novels.Sci-fiction and horror novel are my favorite ones. I read "invisible man",
          "canterville ghost" and currently reading "51 sleepless nights".Little bit inspired by autobiographies as well,I read the novel "The Story
          Of My Life" written by Hellen Keller.Sort of animal lover!! I am a typical dog lover. Love to help others.Nature's beauty excite me more than
          any artificial technology.The best time I spend hanging out is with my pet dog or being at places where you can observe nature easily.</p>
          <p>Thanks for visiting this page!!</p>
          <p>Have a nice day!!</p>
